# Foreword Core -- open capabilities

Quire-domain backlog. The shape and priority order for the platform live in
`docs/PM/CurrentPlan.md`; there is no platform-wide register any more.
Anything that is this quire's own behaviour lives here.

The rules are the standing ones: an entry says what is still missing and
nothing else, a closed entry is DELETED rather than annotated, and a gap that
is still real is never quietly dropped.

## The shared mixer

`Foreword chapter Random` supplies `mix-bits` and `rand-in-range` (CL 10493),
and its prose carries the whole account: why an unfolded multiply-add has no
usable low bits, why that is invisible to a balance check, and -- the part
that matters most -- **why it is only a defect where the consumer reads low
bits.** A remainder by a power of two or a bit-and is degenerate; a remainder
by a large non-power-of-two is often fine. Steering was recorded here as
broken on the strength of its expression, measured, and found fine.

**Read that prose before migrating anything, and measure the consumer rather
than grading the mixer.** `codex/test/mix-bits.codex` is the worked example
and keeps the old mixer as a live negative control.

**Do not touch `ElasticHash`, `FunnelHash`, `Lz4`, `Steering`, `ImageTensor`
or `bloom-hash-text`.** The first two already run a full Murmur-style
finalizer, Lz4 takes the HIGH bits, Steering's modulus saves it, and
ImageTensor's mask is its LCG modulus while the output comes from a division
that reads the high bits. `bloom-hash-text` ends on a fold and measures 7 and
2 false positives per 500 at 1024 and 1021 bits, which is healthy; it is
pinned by `codex/test/bloom-spread` alongside the integer path. All measured.
They are named so nobody re-audits them.

**Grading a mixer by reading it was wrong again, and this time in the other
direction.** CORE-3 was recorded here as "duplication rather than defect,"
because both `chr-hash-key` and `chr-hash-pair` ended on a fold. Running the
consumer showed a ring that sent 993 of 1000 keys to one node: the two hashes
were on different SCALES, so every key hashed past every vnode and wrapped to
the first entry. The fold was never the question. Of six chapters graded from
their expressions, two were falsely accused and one was falsely cleared.

The rule that came out of that, and which outlives the rows it was learned
from: **a grade read off an expression is a HYPOTHESIS until its consumer is
run.** Four chapters were graded broken from their expressions and two of
them (Steering, ImageTensor) measured fine. Migrating a chapter CHANGES ITS
OUTPUT, so each is its own changelist with its own re-recorded expectations.

## Open

Nothing. The last entry was CORE-7, the `pb-memory-kb` field that held a
block count, and the field is now `pb-block-count`.
